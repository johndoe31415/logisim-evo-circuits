# Logisim Evolution Library
This is a tiny circuit library I wrote for LogiSim Evolution. Some of the
circuits are gate-level models (transcribed as directly from the respective
datasheet as possible), others are behavioral models (modeled as a ROM
internally).

| Part  | Description                           | Type       |
|-------|---------------------------------------|------------|
| 7447  | BCD-to-seven-segment decoders/drivers | Gate-level |
| 74181 | 4-bit arithmetic logic unit           | Gate-level |
| 74185 | Binary-to-BCD converter               | Behavioral |
